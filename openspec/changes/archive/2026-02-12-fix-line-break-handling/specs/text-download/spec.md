## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Episode download
The system SHALL download each episode's HTML page, extract the body text, and save it as a text file.

#### Scenario: Episode is downloaded and saved
- **WHEN** an episode page is fetched successfully
- **THEN** the body text is extracted from the HTML and saved as a `.txt` file in the output directory

#### Scenario: Episode download fails
- **WHEN** an individual episode fails to download
- **THEN** the error is logged, the episode is skipped, and the download continues with the next episode

#### Scenario: Ruby (furigana) tags are preserved
- **WHEN** the episode HTML contains ruby tags (e.g., `<ruby>漢字<rp>(</rp><rt>かんじ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>`)
- **THEN** the ruby information is preserved in the saved text file as HTML tags

#### Scenario: Paragraph separation matches web display
- **WHEN** the episode HTML contains consecutive `<p>` tags with text content
- **THEN** the extracted text SHALL join paragraphs with a single newline character (`\n`), matching the line spacing displayed on the web page

#### Scenario: Intentional blank lines are preserved
- **WHEN** the episode HTML contains empty `<p>` tags (containing only `<br>` or whitespace)
- **THEN** the extracted text SHALL preserve each empty `<p>` as a blank line, reproducing scene breaks and intentional spacing from the original web page

#### Scenario: Multiple consecutive blank lines are preserved
- **WHEN** the episode HTML contains multiple consecutive empty `<p>` tags
- **THEN** the extracted text SHALL preserve each empty `<p>` as a separate blank line, maintaining the original spacing
